<h1>Hello Basketball Player</h1>

 <p><strong>Basketball</strong> is my favorite sport of all time. It is also my passion for life.
   My uncle is the one who inspired me to play basketball. My 3 favorite basketball players are Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant and Micheal Jordan.
   Basketball is a great way to get your mind off things and express yourself. Every time I step out on the court,
   it becomes a chance for me to show every aspects of who I really am from an emotional, physical, and competitive standpoint.
