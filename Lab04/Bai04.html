 <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
 <p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
 <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized version were formed as a
   <br /> reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <u>English estate gardens</u>.</p>
 <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more pratical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
